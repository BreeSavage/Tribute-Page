        <h3 id="tribute-info">Early Life and Career</h3>
     <p>
        Jemisin was born Nora K. Jemisin in Iowa City, Iowa in 1972. She earned a Bachelor of Science
        in Psychology before going on to earn her Master of Education. She worked primarily as a 
        counseling psychologist while writing science fiction short stories on the side. In 2016 Jemisin
        began writing a science fiction book review coloumn for the New York Times entitled, "Otherworldly".
        In 2016 she also started a Patreon campaign to fundraise enough money to allow her to quit
        her "day job" as a psychologist and focus full time on writing. Her success with her Patreon campaign
        paid off when in that same year Jemisin became the first African American to ever win the Hugo Award
        for best Novel. Jemisin is most well known for her <em>Broken Earth</em> series which earned her the 
        Hugo Award for Best Novel three years in a row. She is the only author ever to have achieved this feat.

        <em> "So here is why I write what I do: We all have futures. We all have pasts. 
            We all have stories. And we all, every single one of us, no matter who we 
            are and no matter what’s been taken from us or what poison we’ve internalized 
            or how hard we’ve had to work to expel it—we all get to dream." - N.K Jemisin</em>

        <em>“Tell them they can be great someday, like us. Tell them they belong among us, 
            no matter how we treat them. Tell them they must earn the respect which everyone
             else receives by default. Them them there is a standard for acceptance; that 
             standard is simply perfection. Kill those who scoff at those contradictions, 
             and tell the rest that the dead deserved annihilation for their weakness and 
             doubt. Then they'll break themselves trying for what they'll never achieve”
