     <p>
        Jemisin was born Nora K. Jemisin in Iowa City, Iowa in 1972. She earned a Bachelor of Science
        in Psychology before going on to earn her Master of Education. She worked primarily as a 
        counseling psychologist while writing science fiction short stories on the side. In 2016 Jemisin
        began writing a science fiction book review coloumn for the New York Times entitled, "Otherworldly".
        In 2016 she also started a Patreon campaign to fundraise enough money to allow her to quit
        her "day job" as a psychologist and focus full time on writing. Her success with her Patreon campaign
        paid off when in that same year Jemisin became the first African American to ever win the Hugo Award
        for best Novel. Jemisin is most well known for her <em>Broken Earth</em> series which earned her the 
        Hugo Award for Best Novel three years in a row. She is the only author ever to have achieved this feat.
